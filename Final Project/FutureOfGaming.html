<p>Here are some upcoming games I am excited for:</p>
<p>One game I am especially excited for is Grand Theft Auto 6. I have been excited for the release of this game for years, but after the recent trailer for the game has been released my expectations and excitement has increased. The game looks very good and I've read about the extreme amount of content they have added to the game. Another game I am excited for is the Elder Scrolls 6. There isn't much confirmed about the game right now, but it is speculated to release in 2026. If you viewed my favorite games on the favorite games tab then you know that my favorite game is The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim. My expectations are high for The Elder Scrolls 6 because of how much fun I had and still have playing Skyrim. Also with the power of next-gen consoles the Elder Scrolls 6 will have even more content than the last game.</p>
