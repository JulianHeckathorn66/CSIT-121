			<td>Bethesda Game Studios</td>
			<td>The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim</td>
			<td>Skyrim is my all-time favorite game because of its beautiful open world and very fun gameplay. It has a lot of replayability and I have gone back and replayed it from start to finish many times. I love all the background music and the diverse characters you meet along your adventure. I also love that I decide the pace and what adventures I want to set out on instead of being forced on one path.</td>

		<tr>
			<td>Nintendo</td>
			<td>The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time</td>
			<td>The Legend of Zelda series is my favorite game series made by Nintendo with this specific title being my favorite of them all. I was shown this game early on in my childhood and I instantly fell in love with it. The music really stands out to me in this game. In fact, hearing it now gives me a nice nostalgic feeling.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>FromSoftware</td>
			<td>Elden Ring</td>
			<td>Elden Ring is much more recent than the previous two on the list, but I still have a fondness for it even without any nostalgia. Elden Ring is the first "Souls type" game I have played from this company who is famous for making the Dark Souls series. Elden ring features a massive open world just like the last two games, but its gameplay is much more challenging. That challenge made me want to keep playing even when I'm stuck on one boss for hours because the feeling of joy you get when finally beating them is indescribable. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ubisoft</td>
			<td>Assassin's Creed 2</td>
			<td>Assassin's Creed is another game series that I enjoy playing all the games in, much like Legend of Zelda. However, the story of Ezio Auditore told in Assassin's creed 2 makes it my personal favorite entry to the series. Also the gameplay was fresher and had more features than the original Assassin's Creed which made it more enjoyable to play. Also like the other games on this list the music is amazing and helps to get you more invested in the characters.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Rockstar Games</td>
			<td>Grand Theft Auto 5</td>
			<td>Grand Theft Auto 5 is one of the best selling games in history and for good reason. I enjoyed playing the story mode of the game and following the stories of the three criminals. I loved driving around the city and countryside in all types of vehicles and doing missions to get more money. However, the story mode isn't the reason it's one of my favorite games. It is my favorite because of Grand Theft Auto Online which gave me the ability to create my own character and do everything from story mode with friends. I've spent hours driving around the map with my friends having fun and making memories. It is one of the easiest games to just jump into and have fun without really making progress. </td>
